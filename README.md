<h2 id="main-features">‚ú® Main Features</h2>

- **üó∫Ô∏è Real-World Data:** Get up-to-date VFR and IFR navigation data for airports, airfields, and waypoints in Italy. The data is in CSV format, which is easy to use.
- **‚úàÔ∏è Enhanced Flight Simulation:** Have a more realistic flight experience with our authentic CSV data.
- **ü§ù Community Driven:** Our navigation data is updated by a passionate community, making sure it's accurate. All our data is stored in CSV format.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Open Source:** All data is free and open source, so it's transparent and easy to collaborate on. This includes our CSV formatted data.
-  **üîç Easy to Use:** Our CSV data is designed to be easy to read and use.

<h2 id="about-project">‚úàÔ∏è About The Project</h2>

OpenEpops helps you have an authentic flight simulation experience in Italy. We give you a complete set of real-world VFR and IFR navigation information. This includes airports, airfields, waypoints, and more. Our goal is to give flight simulator fans free, high-quality CSV data to create the most realistic experience possible.

<h2 id="data-sources">üóÑÔ∏è Data Sources</h2>

-   **OpenNav:** Thanks for providing open-source flight data, which is part of our large navigation database.
-   **Aeronovigator & Pobeda Virtual Airlines:** We really appreciate their community pilots for sharing their *own*, private AIRAC databases. These are constantly updated for flight simulators. Created by real pilots, these databases fix common sim errors. They are very important, and we are very grateful for making this possible in Europe, where this data is hard to find for free while respecting copyrights. We also expect to add more data across Europe because of their help.
-   **OpenFlightMaps:** Special thanks to the people in charge, especially Max Belloni and Raffaele Farina, for making most of our VFR data possible.
-   **X-Plane NAV810:** We thank Robin A. Peel for making the first IFR data public. This was an important start for our IFR data. We found this useful data through the FlightGear community and agree with their idea of creating reusable and improvable data.
-   **Community-Verified Updates & Data:** We appreciate the community's help, which makes our data accurate through constant updates and fixes.
